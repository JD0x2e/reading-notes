    <h1>What is a wireframe?</h1>
    <p>Wireframing is a practice which is used by UX Designers
        which allows them to plan and layout the design of their webpage,
        app or product.</p>
    <p>It is a great way for teams of people to be able
        to collaboratively create a design which will work
        for every user which may interact with your interface</p>    
    <p>A commonly used argument of wireframing is that, if a user
        doesn't know where to go on a plain hand-drawn diagram, then it
        won't matter how many fancy texts and colours you use on your
        desired platform.
    </p>

    <h2><em>Typical examples of wireframes</em></h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Pencil and paper drawn</li>
        <li>Whiteboard</li>
        <li>Software developed</li>
    </ul>
    <h2><em>Structural process of wireframes</em></h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Wireframe > Interactive Prototype > Visual > Design</li>
        <li>Sketch > Code</li>
        <li>Sketch > Wireframe > Hi-Def Wireframe > Visual > Code</li>
        <li>Sketch > Wireframe > Visual > Code</li>
    </ul>
    <h2><em>Best tools for wireframes</em></h2>
    <ol>
        <li>UXPin - it builds responsive, clickable prototypes directly
            in the browser</li>
        <li>InVision - allows feedback directly to the team/users
            through clickable mock-ups</li>
        <li>Wireframe.cc - provides the tech to be able to create 
            quickly in the browser, digital version of pen and paper</li>
    </ol>
    <h2><em>6 Steps to make a wireframe</em></h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Do your research: Before you even start getting stuff down
            on pen and paper, you need to have an idea of what you
            want to do, who will use it and what does it all mean?</li><br>
        <li>Prepare your research for quick reference: Cheatsheets are
            a great way to get quick information down which you might 
            want to recall at a moments notice later down the line.</li><br>
        <li>Make sure you have your user flow mapped out: You need to know
            where the user will be coming from, and where you would like
            them to end up, aka 'User Flows' & 'Information Architecture'</li><br>
        <li>Draft and sketch: Grab a pen/sharpie 
            and ask yourself some simple questions such as,<br><br>- How can you organise
            the content to support your users goals?<br><br>- Which information is the most
            important?<br><br>- What should the user first see when arriving on the page?<br><br>
            - Which buttons or touch points does the user need to click to complete the
            desired actions?<br><br></li>
        <li>Add detail and get testing: Add detail however you want and start
            testing it out. Remember the wireframe is skeleton of the site!</li><br>
        <li>Start turning wireframes into prototypes: Start putting your wireframes
            onto prototypes such as Sketch and more popular, Figma.<br><br>
        </li>    
    </ol>

    <h1>What is HTML?</h1>
    <p>HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the code that is used to structure a
        web page and its content. For example, content could be structured within
        a set of paragraphs, a list of bulleted points, or using images and data
        tables.</p>

## Growth Mindset
### What is a growth mindset?

You can grow out of a fixed mindset by always putting in the effort and perseverance. No matter what point you start at, putting in the work will make you grow.

### How to stay in a growth mindset?

1. When facing a challenge, rather than being scared and avoiding the issue, you should embrace it and don't give up.
2. Stay persistent. At each obstacle you face, rather than avoiding and losing focus, persist.
3. Take on board all criticism, don't ignore it. It will help you to keep growing your mind.

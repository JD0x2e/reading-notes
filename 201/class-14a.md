## CSS Transforms

*What does a CSS transform allow the developer to do to an element?*

The CSS transform property allows you to rotate, scale, skew or translate an element. 

*Provide an example of a transform and how you could see that being used on a website.*

You can rotate 2d objects also with the `transform: rotate(20deg)` for example. 

You can scale different objects with `transform: scale(1.25)` for example.

You can translate 2D by using `transform: translate(10px)` for example.

You can also skew different objects by using the `transform: skew(5deg)` for example.

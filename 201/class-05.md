# Reading

## HTML Media

**Alternative text** or 'alt' for short; Its value is supposed to be a textual description of that particular image, for use in certain situations where the internet connection may be particularly slow so the webpage cannot render the image, so you can hover over it and it will tell you what it is. Other reasons why you would use an alt attribute would be;

- The user is visually impaired and is using a screen reader.
- The spelling of the file or path name might be wrong.
- The browser doesn't support images, they may use a text-only browser such as Lynx, which displays alt text.
- Users may have turned off images to reduce the data transfer, common on mobile phones.

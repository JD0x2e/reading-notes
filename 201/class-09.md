# HTML Forms

*Why are forms so important in web development?*

Web forms are one of the most important parts of interaction between a user and a website/app. They allow the user to enter data which can then be sent to a web server for processing and storage. Alternatively, they can be used on the client side to update the interface in some way instantly, e.g add another item to a list.

*When designing a form, what are some key things to keep in mind when it comes to user experience?*

When desigining a form, remember that less is more, and to keep it simple. Sometimes if you add too much information which the user must enter, they will  get frustated and leave. Stay focused.

## Unordered lists

Unoredered lists are for grouping together a collection of different items when there is
no numerical order, and the order of the list doesn't matter. They are displayed with
bullet points.

Example:
- a
- b
- c
- d

To change the bullet style of your UL, you need to change it in your CSS file under the 
'list-style-type' property. You can change it to a dot, circle, or square.

## Ordered lists

You should use an ordered list over an unordered, when you need to make sure that the list
is in the correct numerical order, for example, if you are following a cooking recipe. They
are typically displayed with a preceding marker such as a number or letter.

Example:
1. a
2. b
3. c
4. d

To change the number to Roman Numeral type on an ordered list, you can add a `<ol type="i">`

To change the starting number on your list to start at 5 for example, you can add a `<ol start="5">`

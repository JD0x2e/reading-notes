## Learn CSS - Flexbox

*Flexbox is designed for one-dimensional content. Explain what this means*

Flexbox is very useful for taking a bunch of different boxes and/or items, which all have different sizes, and returning the best layout for those items.

*Explain the difference between the main axis and cross axis*

**Main axis** - This is set by the 'flex-direction' property, if its 'row, it will be along the row and same with column. This runs along the X axis.

**Cross axis** - This is the opposite of the main axis, so if 'flex-direction' is row, it runs along the column. Also known as the Y axis. You can move items individually or as a group.

*How can using certain properties of flexbox negatively impact accessibility?*

You need to be very cautious when using certain properties, such as 'reverse' or 'column-reverse', because these re-order the visual order but not the logical order. Logical order is the order in which the screen reader will read out the code, and anyone which navigates using the keyboard.

## CSS Layout - Flexbox

*What are some advantages of using flexbox over float?*

Flexbox is responsive and mobile-friendly. The margins don't collapse with the margins of its content either. You can also change the order of the elements on our webpage without making any changes in our HTML document.

Here is a summary of what topics I have learned today:

# Heading 

This is the biggest heading size, equivalent of a h1


## Heading level 2

This is the second biggest heading size, equivalent of a h2

As we add more #, it decreases the size of the header, all the way up to ###### (h6)

We can use **bold** for making our text appear bold

We also learned that to we can _italicize_ text to make it appear italic

There is also different versions of lists which we can use depending on the format we want:

This format below is for an ordered list, if we want to use that, you use a 1. ;

1. First
2. Second
3. Third

The format below is for an unordered list, if we want to use that, you use a - ;

- First
- Second
- Third

Here is a summary of what topics I have learned today:

# Heading 

This is the biggest heading size, equivalent of a h1


## Heading level 2

This is the second biggest heading size, equivalent of a h2

As we add more #, it decreases the size of the header, all the way up to ###### (h6)

We can use **bold text** for making our text appear bold

We learned that we can use *italicized text* format for doing the italicized stuff done

Its interesting to know that we can do the lists using the following format:

1. First list item 
2. Second list item
3. Third list item

Its also interseting to know that we can even use unordered lists by following the above rules:

- First list item
- Second list item
- Third list item
